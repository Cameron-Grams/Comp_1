# TSA Screening Delay Dashboard

Deployed, 13 June build pack working: [heroku.](https://arcane-ravine-69645.herokuapp.com/ )


This application combines data on flight delays from the FAA with data from the TSA on estimated delays due to security screening to produce a single view with the best estimate of imapacts to travel time. 

This is accomplished by using a proxy endpoint on Heroku to render the information in the browser.

To use this application locally;
    - clone the repository
    - enter "npm install" from the command line to load the node modules
    - enter "npm run start" to start the react development server on localhost://3000
