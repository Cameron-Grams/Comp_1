Application Flow:
1. The baseline FAA application was modified by adding the TSA Screening delay information on the
   'Dashboard' and 'Marker' components by rendering a <TSAScreeningEstimate /> component

2. The <TSAScreeningEstimate /> takes one prop, the initials of the airport being highlighted as
   recognized by "this.state.details" on the 'Dashboard' and passed down as an 'airport' object to
   the 'Marker' component

3. The <TSAScreeningEstimate /> component itself is stateful and reflects the loading of a data call
   to the TSA endpoint 

4. The TSA endpoint responds with XML and is managed by the checkpointAPI.js helper module

5. The checkpointAPI.js helper module uses a proxy endpoint hosted on heroku to be able to process 
   the TSA response in the browser.

6. The response from the TSA server is managed as an object and evaluated by estimated length of time
   and rendered with the appropriate color, as recognized by the variables defined in config.js, and
   held on Heroku as environmental variables.  

 
Significant Points:
1. Free services and delay; 
    - proxy endpoint on Heroku
    - FAA information? 

2. TSA Screening delay information and loading
    - more current
    - delay...
